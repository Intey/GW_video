# Link Getter
Little gist (but not) for fetching data from some url. 
Just for lulz.

## Install & Start
### Requirements
- Node.js
- npm
- (look package.json)

If in this repo you can't find `node_modules`, so you lucky. 
Use:  `npm install` to get dependencies.

After all, just insert in `adata` file username and password for site, and run

`node harvester.js`
