Little gist (but not) for fetching data from some url. 
Just for lulz.

## Install & Start
### Requirements
- Node.js

All dependencies already in node_modules.

1. Create directory videos, or change `dest_path` in `harverster.js` to exists folder: videos will be downloads in it.
2. Insert in `adata` file username and password for site
3. Run `node harvester.js` and wait.
